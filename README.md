## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned
I learned how to shorten a paragraph in html by using line break <br> which improves readability


```html
.proud-of-this-html
<p class="text-1">Scan the QR code to visit Frontend<br>
        Mentor and take your coding skills to <br>the next level</p>

I also learned how to center text in a html page by setting the display as table-cell and centering the text
...css
.proud-of-this-css {
  display: table-cell;
  text-align: center;
}
```
``

### Continued development
I would like to do more research and a lot of practice on aligning items on a website and typography.



### Useful resources

- [Zindua Coding School](https://zinduaschool.thinkific.com/) - This helped me to understand how to create web content for different device displays. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Mozilla documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This is an amazing article which helped me understand how to position elements on a website. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
